# Eventweb

EventWeb is a self-hosted web platform developed using Laravel and Inertia.js for hosting information about small events, including location, ticketing embeds, and social links. Eventweb was originally built for one specific event but was modified for general use.

## Features
- Invite users to manage events and site contents.
- Attach embeds from ticketing platforms to events. At this moment only Tickettailor is supported but more are planned.
- Hide events that are not ready yet for public view
- Hide ticketing embeds when events are ready for public view but tickets are not available yet.
- Preview hidden events as an admin user
- Add social links for display on the event site
- Show instagram feed on the home page to easily give an impression of your event

## Planned features
- Support for ticketing platforms other than Tickettailor
- Modifying site contents and banner/logo via the admin dashboard
- Proper permission management and permissions for administrator actions, through roles
- Full user management for higher administrators
- Setting a favicon via the admin dashboard

Using my code and like it? Please consider leaving a tip for my hard work. This project started off as a favor but ended up potentially landing me in hot water for no reason. It would be much appreciated if this still ends up earning me some pocket money. [I have a ko-fi!](https://ko-fi.com/naamloos)
